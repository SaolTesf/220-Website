          Volunteering in 220 is not a casual decision — it is a calling. We do not throw bodies at open slots. We invite people in carefully because the souls of young people are at stake, because the witness of the gospel is precious, and because we want every leader to flourish, not flame out. The onboarding journey laid out below is intentional. It is designed to help you understand what you are stepping into, to help us know you, and to ensure that the right person ends up in the right role at the right time.
